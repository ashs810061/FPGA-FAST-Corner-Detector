## 📖 Introduction
This project implements a high-performance **FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) Corner Detector** using a heterogeneous computing architecture on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC (PYNQ platform).

The computationally intensive feature extraction task is offloaded to the **Programmable Logic (PL)**, utilizing **VDMA (Video Direct Memory Access)** for high-speed data transfer. A custom TCP/IP communication protocol enables real-time data streaming to a Host PC, which visualizes the results on a comprehensive dashboard.

This system demonstrates a complete **Hardware-Software Co-design**, achieving significant acceleration and energy efficiency compared to pure software implementations.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Hardware Acceleration**: Custom IP core for FAST Corner Detection and NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) implemented on FPGA.
* **High-Throughput Data Path**: Utilizes AXI-Stream and VDMA to maximize memory bandwidth and minimize CPU intervention.
* **Client-Server Architecture**:
    * **Server (PYNQ)**: Handles hardware control, VDMA management, and algorithm execution.
    * **Client (PC)**: Multi-threaded Python GUI for real-time visualization, performance monitoring, and bandwidth analysis.
* **Real-time Dashboard**: Displays live FPS charts, bandwidth usage (MB/s), and processing latency.
* **Adaptive Visualization**: Supports switching between "All Corners" and "Strong Corners" modes instantly.

## 🛠️ System Architecture
The system utilizes a heterogeneous architecture where the ARM CPU handles network communication and VDMA configuration, while the FPGA PL accelerates the image processing pipeline.

## 🧩 FAST IP Core Architecture
The hardware accelerator is designed with a highly parallelized pipeline to achieve 100MHz real-time processing. The core logic consists of three main stages:

### 1. FAST Feature Extraction Pipeline

#### Line Buffer & Window Generation
Uses 7 rows of Block RAM (BRAM) to store incoming pixel streams. The design simultaneously accesses a 7x7 pixel neighborhood in a single clock cycle to evaluate the Bresenham circle (Radius=3).

![Line Buffer](https://github.com/ashs810061/FPGA-FAST-Corner-Detector/blob/main/FPGA-FAST-Corner-Detector/Docs/line_buffer.png?raw=true)

#### Parallel Difference & Thresholding
Calculates the absolute difference `|Ip - Ix|` for all 16 pixels on the circle concurrently. A dual-threshold mechanism (High/Low) generates bitmasks to identify strong and weak corners without stalling the pipeline.

### 2. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) Pipeline

To refine the results, a 3x3 Non-Maximum Suppression stage filters out clustered corners.

#### 3x3 Window Generation
A secondary line buffer structure creates a 3x3 sliding window over the FAST score stream.

#### Comparator Tree Logic
A parallel comparator tree evaluates the center pixel against its 8 neighbors in a single cycle, ensuring only the local maximum is retained.

## ⚙️ Hardware Implementation Results

The hardware accelerator is implemented on the **Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+** FPGA. The following data is obtained from the Vivado post-implementation reports.

### 1. Resource Utilization
The FAST Corner Detector IP utilizes approximately 36% of the available LUTs, demonstrating a balanced trade-off between hardware complexity and performance.

| Resource | Utilization | Available | Utilization % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LUT** (Look-Up Tables) | 42,498 | 117,120 | **36.29 %** |
| **LUTRAM** | 1,400 | 57,600 | **2.43 %** |
| **FF** (Flip-Flops) | 39,715 | 234,240 | **16.95 %** |
| **BRAM** (Block RAM) | 6.50 | 144 | **4.51 %** |

> *Vivado post-implementation utilization report.*

### 2. Power Consumption
Total on-chip power consumption is **3.301 W**. Notably, the FPGA Programmable Logic (PL) itself consumes significantly less power compared to the Processing System (PS), proving the extreme energy efficiency of the hardware accelerator.

| Power Component | Consumption (Watts) | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dynamic Power** | **2.871 W** | PS: ~2.732W (94%), PL: ~0.139W (6%) |
| **Device Static Power** | **0.430 W** | |
| **Total On-Chip Power** | **3.301 W** | |

> *Vivado power analysis report. The majority of dynamic power is consumed by the PS (ARM CPU), while the custom hardware logic remains highly efficient.*

## 📊 System Performance Benchmark

The following benchmark compares the end-to-end execution time of the FAST algorithm running on the **ARM Cortex-A53 CPU (OpenCV implementation)** versus the **FPGA Hardware Accelerator**.

| Implementation | Processing Time (ms) | Throughput (FPS) | Speedup |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Software (ARM CPU)** | ~30.22 ms | ~33.0 FPS | 1.0x |
| **Hardware (FPGA)** | **~11.05 ms** | **~90.5 FPS** | **2.73x** |

> *Terminal output demonstrating the hardware processing latency (~11ms) and high throughput.*

### ⚠️ Performance Note: Connection Interface
The system supports both Gigabit Ethernet and USB-Ethernet (RNDIS) connections.
* **Gigabit Ethernet (RJ45)**: Recommended for maximum throughput (**90+ FPS**).
* **Micro USB (Ethernet over USB)**: If using the USB interface, the effective frame rate will be limited to **~35-40 FPS** due to the bandwidth limitations and protocol overhead of the USB 2.0 standard. *Note: The internal hardware acceleration speed remains unaffected.*
