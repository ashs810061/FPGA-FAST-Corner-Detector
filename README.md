## 📖 Introduction
This project implements a high-performance **FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) Corner Detector** using a heterogeneous computing architecture on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC (PYNQ platform).

The computationally intensive feature extraction task is offloaded to the **Programmable Logic (PL)**, utilizing **VDMA (Video Direct Memory Access)** for high-speed data transfer. A custom TCP/IP communication protocol enables real-time data streaming to a Host PC, which visualizes the results on a comprehensive dashboard.

This system demonstrates a complete **Hardware-Software Co-design**, achieving significant acceleration and energy efficiency compared to pure software implementations.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Hardware Acceleration**: Custom IP core for FAST Corner Detection and NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) implemented on FPGA.
* **High-Throughput Data Path**: Utilizes AXI-Stream and VDMA to maximize memory bandwidth and minimize CPU intervention.
* **Client-Server Architecture**:
    * **Server (PYNQ)**: Handles hardware control, VDMA management, and algorithm execution.
    * **Client (PC)**: Multi-threaded Python GUI for real-time visualization, performance monitoring, and bandwidth analysis.
* **Real-time Dashboard**: Displays live FPS charts, bandwidth usage (MB/s), and processing latency.
* **Adaptive Visualization**: Supports switching between "All Corners" and "Strong Corners" modes instantly.

## ⚙️ Hardware Implementation Results

The hardware accelerator is implemented on the **Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+** FPGA. The following data is obtained from the Vivado post-implementation reports.

### 1. Resource Utilization
The FAST Corner Detector IP utilizes approximately 36% of the available LUTs, demonstrating a balanced trade-off between hardware complexity and performance.

| Resource | Utilization | Available | Utilization % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LUT** (Look-Up Tables) | 42,498 | 117,120 | **36.29 %** |
| **LUTRAM** | 1,400 | 57,600 | **2.43 %** |
| **FF** (Flip-Flops) | 39,715 | 234,240 | **16.95 %** |
| **BRAM** (Block RAM) | 6.50 | 144 | **4.51 %** |

### 2. Power Consumption
Total on-chip power consumption is **3.301 W**. Notably, the FPGA Programmable Logic (PL) itself consumes significantly less power compared to the Processing System (PS), proving the extreme energy efficiency of the hardware accelerator.

| Power Component | Consumption (Watts) | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dynamic Power** | **2.871 W** | PS: ~2.732W (94%), PL: ~0.139W (6%) |
| **Device Static Power** | **0.430 W** | |
| **Total On-Chip Power** | **3.301 W** | |

## 📊 System Performance Benchmark

The following benchmark compares the end-to-end execution time of the FAST algorithm running on the **ARM Cortex-A53 CPU (OpenCV implementation)** versus the **FPGA Hardware Accelerator**.

| Implementation | Processing Time (ms) | Throughput (FPS) | Speedup |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Software (ARM CPU)** | ~30.22 ms | ~33.0 FPS | 1.0x |
| **Hardware (FPGA)** | **~11.05 ms** | **~90.5 FPS** | **2.73x** |

### ⚠️ Performance Note: Connection Interface
The system supports both Gigabit Ethernet and USB-Ethernet (RNDIS) connections.
* **Gigabit Ethernet (RJ45)**: Recommended for maximum throughput (**90+ FPS**).
* **Micro USB (Ethernet over USB)**: If using the USB interface, the effective frame rate will be limited to **~35-40 FPS** due to the bandwidth limitations and protocol overhead of the USB 2.0 standard. *Note: The internal hardware acceleration speed remains unaffected.*
